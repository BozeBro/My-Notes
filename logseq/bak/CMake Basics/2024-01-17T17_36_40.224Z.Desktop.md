- Targets are the main job of CMake, either an executable or a library
- Create custom targets with add_custom_target
- Targets can have their own properties
	- compilation flags (CFLAGS)
	- linking flags (LDFLAGS)
	- preprocessor flags
	- C/C++ standard
	- included directories
	- etc.
Set flags via targets over directories <-- modern cmake
