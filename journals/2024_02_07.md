- DONE #15418 What are coherence misses? A coherence miss is when two threads are writing to a private cache space. After an update, the cache entry is stale for another processor
	- Think about renderer in terms of array, not graph oriented

- #15330/Lecture
	- Control Flow integrity
		- protects against power adversary
		- widely applicable
		- trustworthy
		- efficient
	- #Program-Analysis in this days lecture
	- Soundness: If analysis says X is true, then X is true
		- better to be quiet then tell a lie
		- Trivial: never say anything is true
	- Complete: If X is true, the analysis says X
		- Trivial: Say everything is true
	- Rice Theorem - there is no sound and complete analysis for non trivial property for programs
	- Proving Type safety: Preservation: if a program is well-typed at step i, then it is well preserved at step i + 1
	- Progress: If program is well-typed at step i, it has either finished or it can take another step.
	- type safety does not mean security safety --> information flow
		- Security via non-interference
	- [[Control flow integrity]] - Adversary can overwrite data memory at any time
		- adversary cannot execute data
		- modify code
		- write to rip
		- overwrite registers
	- Analysis assumes
		- code compiles w cfi (control flow integrity)
	- Execution must follow a path in a control flow graph created ahead of run time
