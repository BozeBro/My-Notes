	- [The Practice of Programming](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/tpop.webpage/),
	  at least the first few chapters.
	- Speaking of textbooks, if your relationship with 15-213/513
	  didn't involve a lot of textbook time,
	  please be aware that we expect you to be able to *apply*
	  a 213-level understanding of relevant 213 topics,
	  including files and directories, file I/O, signals,
	  and virtual memory,
	  in addition to the absolutely core machine-model material
	  on instructions, registers, and caches.
	  If you are fuzzy on any of this,
	  the 213 textbook contains excellent refresher material!
	- ~~#TODO Review 213 code (especially shell and malloc)~~

- #15213 Casting Rules in C
	- Explicitly place U behind numerics for unsigned representation
	- Expression Evaluation:
		- mix of signed and unsigned --> implicitly cast to unsigned
			- negative numbers change to positive by examining bit representation
	- Small bit number to large bit number
		- Extend the front bit by however bits needed
			- E.g. 10_2 == 1110_4
	- Big bit number to small big number
		- Truncate top bits until at proper bit count
			- E.g. 1111_4 == 11_2
	- Unsigned numbers do Modular arithmetic
	- Multiplication - do it and drop top bits
	- Note, division shifts to the left, not towards, 0
- #15213 Byte Orderings - x86 uses Little Endian rules
	- least important byte is in the lowest address
		- Variable has value of 0x01234567, then Little Endian looks like
			- 67, 45, 23, 01 (lowest to highest)
- #os-prep Different ways to handle errors (for debugging purposes)
	- Pass-the-buck: return an error code
		- Good if you expect the caller to handle the error code for you
	- Assertions: assert the location and line number where an error occured
		- Can be better than tediously looking at all locations where something occurs.
	- Panic can inform us about certain information that might be useful/helpful.
		- Print out the current state
		   Registers
		   Any state variables stored in the kernel
		   Surrounding stack near the %esp
		   Surrounding stack of the user program, if applicable
	- Just because you solve the project without any interrupts, it doesn't mean that once locking is in place, race conditions won't exist. Suggestion: After TCB and PCB are done, strive to not disable interrupts.
- Locking/concurrency seems to be a really scary part of OS
- #15213/Shell Linux files is represented as sequence of bytes (byte representation)
	- All Linux I/O devices are represented as files.
		- E.g. /dev/sda2, /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-55-generic (the kernel image)
- 18:31 Just remet Ester again. I feel bad because I've seen and met her so many times already
	- She's thinking about taking an ML class and I was talking about my OS worries and finding a partner. I'm really gapped this sem lol.
- #15213/Shell File to device mapping allows simple interface for Unix I/O (good abstractions are good to keep)
	- LATER [Interesting blog on file system](https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/debian/book/ch04_03.html)
	- Files is just named bytes
	- open, close for open and close a file
	- read, write for reading and writing
	- lseek() changes files location offset to start reading in a file.
	- Different File Types
		- Regular File that have random data
		- Directories: Index into a list of files
		- Socket: allows communication with other machines
		- Named Pipes (FIFOs), symbolic links, character and block devices
- #Linux This OS operates data via devices that usually associate with hardware units.
	- Pseudodevices can be treated like devices but do not physically exist
- 19:03 In my Intro to Security Class now
- #c++ Big Three (Copy, Destructor, assignment)
	- copy-and-swap idiom helps with strong exception guarantee and code duplication
	- Use value assignment for operator= to get good optimization (have compiler make copies instead of manually)
	- #DONE Continue reading about friend swap function [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5695548/public-friend-swap-member-function)
		- Friend function just allows swap function to access private member variables of a class. Not too much going on here
		- Interesting thing about [ADL](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/adl) Argument dependent lookup, which allows us to use std::swap instead of trying to find proper swap.
