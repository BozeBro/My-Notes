	- Cell parallelism: Low contention rate, low parallelism opportunity (Would need to have thousands of cells but is very weird to think about)
	- particle parallelism: High contention rate, high parallelism opportunity
		- lock per particle to help with contention
	- Compute partial results + merge - Each block does local work on a local grid
		- extra work to merge N grids at end of computation
		- requires extra memory footprint: (store N grid of lists instead of 1)
	- data-parallel approach
