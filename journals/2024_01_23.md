- 12:32 Need to work on 15451 finalization
	- Read up on missed 15418 material that I missed in the past week.
- #15451/Lecture Sorting cannot b done faster than $\Omega (n log n)$ in the comparison model
	- Model (word-RAM), makes assumptions on integers
		- unlimited constant-time memory "registers" --> can query stuff at an address for free
		- Registers can store a w-bit integer (w = "word")
		- Operations on constant number of words take constant time (Reading, arithmetic, logic, bitwise operations)
		- for input size n, $w \geqslant \lg n$
	- Operations done on a large word number cannot be done in constant time
	- Information-Theoretic says if there are $n$ outputs, then the running time is $\lg n$
		- This is in the comparison model
	- #word-ram allows for indirect addressing, have numbers index into correct position.
	- #Integer-Sorting Given array of elements $(a_1, a_2,\ldots a_n)$and integer key is called $key(a_1)$, output a sorted array
		- Duplicates are allowed
		- sorting is stable if relative order of duplicates is preservered
		- elements are arbitrary, but their keys are integers
	- #Counting-Sort
		- input elements have keys in the range $\{0,1,\ldots , u - 1\}$
		- Create a list of every possible key in the universe
		- For each $a_i$, append $a_i$ to list at index $key(a_i)$
		- Concatenate all the lists together. Elements will be sorted
		- $$O(n)$$ time if $$u\in O(n)$$.
	- #LSD-Radix-Sort Least significant Digit Radix Sort
		- Counting sort by the last digit (ones), then the second last (tens), third (hundreds), and onward
		- Runs in $$O((n+b)log_bu)$$ time using base-b
			- n + b => n is going through each word, and b is the digits in base b | Counting Sort on each digit
			- num iterations = num digits = $log_bu$
			- for base b = n, runs in $$O(nlog_nu)$$
			- Sorts keys in $$O(n)$$ time if $$u\in O(n)$$
	- The top down first is more easy to parallelize.
- 18:41 In OH for 15451 to discuss problem Problem 2 on Hw 1
	- Need to look over past content of 15418 because I don't know what's happening in the class rn.
- #Writing
	- Be aware of people's expectations when it comes to things
		- If it looks like candy, people will eat even if it is bad for oyu
	- Readers are often looking for rules of thumbs for rules in technical documents
	- Consider the genre used to convey information? Does it cause a headache to read
		- Read to do > read to learn
	- Busy readers might not look at all the details of your documentation
	- Documents are references usually
	- Readers take in text as an input for the problem they are trying to solve
	- Passive voice tend to recreate scenarios in people's head
	- Readers tend to:
		- resist reading
		- set their own goals for reading
		- immediately start reading the text before looking at the text
	- Scenario writing can help because it puts the reader in the situation that the writer desires
	- Understand frame of mind that readers are using entering into a document
		- Provide a way to frame the reading at the start
		- Write documents in the order that we expect readers to do the task
			- E.g. is the wine glass
- #15418
	- What limits speedups on processors?
		- communication distance between processors
		- Processors running idle
		- Communication costs can dominate speedup potential
	- ILP = Instruction Level Processor
