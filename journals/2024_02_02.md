- 09:38 In #154518/Lecture discussing the #OceanGridSolver
	- Need decomposition (into squares for processors), assignment, and synchronization
	- Critical working sets - sets that want a cache access
	- Put 2d elements into blocks of 2d arrays can help caching on virtual memory (c++, c specific)
- 10:07 #15418/Lecture #GalaxyEvolution
	- Difference in Galaxy, is Ocean only is affected by immediate neighbors, Galaxy particles affects everyone
	- Trick is to look at elements in a radius, and approximate elements out of the radius as a single particle O(nlg) > O(n^2)
	- Parallel trick: traverse tree to get particle information and do update based on particle position
		- Have an idea of a cost zone
	- Accumulate work until W/P and then assign to a processor (using a incremented local variable for a leaf to show how many interactions one has had)

- #ChainReaction/TODO Use FEN notation for game board
- #15451/Recitation - Potential Function
	- $$\phi(s_0) = 0 \& \phi(s_f)\geq 0$$
	- Expensive actual cost want cheap or lower potential
	- cheap expensive operations
	- Example is the deque.
		- s1 is stack 1, s2 is stack 2, s3 is stack 3
- #15330/Recitation
	- Make sure to have correct stack alignment for stack pointer (8 byte aligned)
	- function calls can assume certain byte alignment
