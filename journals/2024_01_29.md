	- Optimizing performance is an iterative process of refining techniques.
		- Do simplest solution first and the measure performance.
	- Goals:
		- balance workload
		- reduce communication (stalling)
		- reduce extra work (overhead)
			- overhead of threads
			- thread assignments
			- communication costs
	- Balance workload
		- #Static-scheduling (scheduling of threads)
			- work to threads is pre-determined (not necessarily at compile time)
			- almost 0 runtime overhead and simple
			- Good when work is predictable
		- #semi-static-scheduling - Cost of work is predictable for near future
			- Need to change infrequentily
		- #dynamic-scheduling
			- execution of tasks is unpredictable
			- Example is primality test, put work into a queue.
			- overhead can be more
	- #Dynamic-scheduling aims to have more tasks than
		- processors for better load balance
		- want to minimize tasks though to minimize overhead
	- #Smart-scheduling - schedule longer tasks first for better chance of load balance
		- (requires knowledge about tasks)
		- Potentially initially increase GRANULARITY in the beginning and then decrease overtime.
	- Granularity = chunk of work size
	- Distributed Queues - costly synchronization during stealing
		- Better locality (producer-consumer locality)
		- many design questions to think about
	- Common Parallel programming paradigms
		- Divide-and-conquer algorithm
			- Fork-join pattern expresses independent work like in D-n-C
	- Examining - cilk-spawn: run spawned thread or in thread in current thread
		- continuation first: record child for later
		- child first: record continuation for later
	- Does it matter?
	- continuation first --> could fill up a queue if spawn every loop iteration
		- like breadth-first traversal of a call graph
	- do child first --> can cause DFS like traversal
		- does not cause queue to fill up very quickly immediately
- LATER #ChainReaction - Work on making the bot client server side more robust
	- Make javascript not rely on the animations from the server

- Meeting with [[Oleh Filipchuk]] on the UI architecture team for #Citadel

- 15:03 In my #Writing class now. I think it'll be about resume
- #15330 - Parts of the compilation process
	- Preprocessor
	- compiler
	- assembler
	- linker
	- Parts of an executable
		- code segment (text)
		- data segment (data)
			- Use readelf to read sections
			- objdump to get disassembly and match symbol locations to source
	- Segments of binary are loaded into memory. Processor executes process in memory
		- fetch, decode, execute cycle.
		- read and write to processor and to memory
	- Parts of a register can be addressed
		- 64 -> 32 -> 16 -> 8
		- RAX, EAX, AH, AL (AH - higher 8 bits), (AL bottom 8 bits)
			- Writing to eax will zero out upper 32 bits

		- preferred, might be
- #15330 syntax for assembly
	- might be nice to look at objdump, gcc -S and as.
	- AT&T syntax is default syntax while intel mirrors it (used in windows stuff)
	- [Word vs byte addressing schemes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2724449/difference-between-word-addressable-and-byte-addressable)
	- [] --> intel, () is AT&T
	- types of assembly, jump (addr), jump register, if flag goto line
	- Control flow EFLAGS - set by instructions implicitly.
		- "e.g." cmp b,a calculates a-b and sets flags
			- CF flag - carry flag
			- ZF Flag - was the result zero?
			- PF flag - what is the parity of the result?
			- OF Flag - did overflow occur?
			- SF flag - is the result signed?
		- if ZF = 0 and SF = 0, then the result is non-negative so eax was greater (Check back probably?)
		- If SF = 1 and OF = 1, the result is negative but overflow occurred
		- else other is smaller
	- Function prologue - instruction set up stack space, save callee saved registers
	- Function Epilogue - instructions to clean up stack space and restore callee saved registers
	- rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8, r9

	- Relook at CUDA lecture and last week's lecture because I wasn't really paying attention
		- Make sure to understand what blocks are INTEL ISPC and what warps are CUDA
- DONE  #15451 Meetup with #Constantine and #Tyrece for Group problem and maybe go to OH
	- Maybe look at past lecture notes to see if I really understand hashing concepts
- LATER #Writing What is happening in writing again? idk what homework there is rn 21:11
- #15418/asst2 - ![CMU Assignment 2.pdf](../assets/CMU_Assignment_2_1706585314782_0.pdf)
	- "-Y" allows enable use of X windows (what are X windows?)
	- examples of the CUDA SDK - ((65b8708b-c6c0-4ba7-ba5e-a3750361a676))
- #15418/asst2/task1. implement the saxpy program (It's matrix multiplication, f(x,y,a) => a*x+y
	- Req:  ((65b872b8-471b-43ca-a523-380fda4606ee))
	- Add timers to the CUDA kernel invocation.
		- we have code to measure process of copying data to GPU, running kernel, and copying data back to the CPU
		- Note: ((65b8747e-1cbd-4d62-ab90-5146e9870e2d))
		- Doesn't look too bad
- #15418/asst2/task2 - reimplementing parallel scan from #15210 and implementing finding peaks problem but quickly
- #15418/asst2/task3 - Creating the render (IT's 10 pages of reading!!)
	- render that draws circles

- #Writing/assigment
	- have effective visual hierarchy
	- grouping - close together $\implies$ groups
	- visual consistency $\implies$ same kind of information mean the same thing, and have similar visual representation
