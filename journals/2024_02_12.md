- #15418/Lecture
	- Shared caches: make coherence easy /TODO Look back at the slides again
	- snooping caches-coherence: all coherence activity is broadcast to all processors in the system by cache controllers.
	- cache controllers snoop memory operations and react to maintain coherence.
	- #snooping-caches
		- e.g. write-through caches
		- P0 writes X and interconnect broadcasts to other processors that address X in local cache in invalid ()turn off invalidation bit)
		- If P1 reads X, it will get a cache miss (communication miss)
		- Write-through policy has high bandwidth requirements
		- write-back caches absorb most write traffic as cache hits.
	- #write-back Invalidation based
		- has state, if in state, don't need to modify caches
		- snoop when caches are accessing my state
	- #write-back/MSI Modified shared invalid
		- modified - line valid in exactly one cache (dirty or exclusive state) <- has current data
		- shared - line valid in one or more caches. caches has data but not allowed to edit
		- invalid : does not have valid copy of the data
		- reads and writes allowed by local CPU
		- bus read, bus write, flush by coherence related bus transactions
	- #MESI - Exclusively clean, you do Regular Read (not bus read) so you don't have to do a write back to memory
	- #MESIF - (F - Forward state) F rather than S. cache with line in F state services misses
		- Used in Intel processors
	- #MOESI - M to S requires flush to memory, transition from M to O (owned but not exclusive) and do not flush to memory
		- others have shared line, one in O state. cache in O must service cache misses
		- in AMD Opteron
	- strengths: M E O F S I
	- Reality: Multi-level cache hierarchies -->
- #Security/Lecture Type Systems
	- Proving Type Safety
		- syntax
		- semantics
		- type checking/typing algorithm
		- proof of type safety
	- Program analysis cannot be both sound and complete
		- allows unsoundness/imcompleteness
		- imposing restrictions on P or properties supported
		- requiring human assistance
	- #Hoare-Logic - formal reasoning about program correctness using pre and post conditions
		- {PRE}Program{POST} <-- Hoare triple
