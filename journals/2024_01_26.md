- 09:50 In Parallel computing lecture right now. A bit late
- #15418/Lecture
	- *Decomposition* - break up problem into tasks that can be carried out in parallel.
		- Doesn't have to be identified statically but in runtime
		- Create at least enough tasks to keep all execution units on a machine busy
	- *Ahmdahl's Law*: dependencies limit maximum speedup in a system
- 12:13 I am really hungry right now. In my 15451 lecture right now
- #15451
	- (k+1) - wise indep $\implies$ k wise indep (Contrapositive is true)
	- Lemmas For any $$ a,b\in \{0,1\}^n$$ if b is uniformally random and indep. if a then a + b mod 2 is unif rand.
	- Split problems into conditional probabilty
	- identify one bit of difference, use that different bit in the proof, and Lemma to show probability bound
- #15330 14:02 Recitation starting now for security
	- DONE Relearn 15213 assembly attack code
- DONE #Writing  Need to do draft of LinkedIn summary along with a printed summary submitted to canvas and printed out
- #15418 ISPC - (Intel SPMD Program Compiler), an extended version of C
	- SPMD = Single Program Multiple Data
		- Runs many instances of the same program in parallel
	- Optimizes for both SIMD lanes and core usage
- {{query (and (task TODO) [[Writing]])}}
