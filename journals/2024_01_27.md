- 00:20 helping out ire with #15210
- 12:03 Studying 15451 and doing the homework
- 13:25 Did problem 2 of the #15451 pset. Not too bad but just figuring out some bugs
- 13:35 Doing my #15330 gradescope homework now
	- Not too sure about 1.1, could be disrespect to persons because engineers were not provided full disclosure of the vulnerability
	- 1.2 Disrespect for persons because they are not treating their data with any sensitivity
	- 2.2 is iffy because idk how to think about the TCB and what to include.
		- My mental model says TCB component failure implies compromise
	- 2.5 Secrecy => concealed information from unauthorized people
		- Integrity => changes only made by authorized people
- 14:36 In my #15451 review session 1
	- DONE Experiment in reimplementing MSD Most significant Digit sort
	  :LOGBOOK:
	  CLOCK: [2024-01-29 Mon 21:11:45]--[2024-01-29 Mon 21:11:47] =>  00:00:02

	- Universal Hash Family - $$P\left(h(x) = h(y)\right)\leq 1/m, \forall h\in H$$
		- m is the size of the range
		- Same as $$\frac{\{h\in H \mid h(x)=h(y)\}}{\mid H\mid }\leq \frac{1}{m}$$
	- $lookup(k)$ - Assuming we can make a hashtable = $$O(1 + m/n)$$
		- cost of 1 to call the hash, and then expected $$m/n$$ elements in the linked list in the slot
	- $insert(k)$ - same complexity
	- bijection exists between matrix that is $$w\times b$$ and a hash function maps from set of size $$2^w\to 2^b$$
	- *k-wise independence definition* $$\forall h\in \mathbb{H}$$ H is the hash family
		- $$P\left(h(x_1)=v_1\land h(x_2)=v_2\land\ldots h(x_i)=v_i\right) = 1/m^k$$
