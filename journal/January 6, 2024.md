- 02:36 Trying out cool new plugins in Obsidian
	- [ ] Figure out Dataview, Templater, Task Manager stuff 🔽
	- [-] 🔼 Recreate Chain Reaction Site Front End with React
	- [ ] ⏫ Read more Source Code and figure out what is going on with it. Examples include: LLVM, BRAFT
- 23:19 Did a bunch of leetcode today. 
	- Talked with my cousins Goldy and Francis
		- Just talking about random stuff and I was shown pictures of past Christmas that happens in the Northeast
	- Francis did his exam and says he missed 1 question.
		- Hopefully he still gets to skip the class. He has another class on Monday
	- Chatted with Yara today. Talked about things that were happening. It seems like she does struggle with friendships atm.
		- I imagine it's due to her very confrontational, loud nature. It can be a deterring.
			- I'm guessing that since her Lebanese friends went to America where it's a bit more standoffish, they might've gotten unused to how Yara can be.
- Still didn't do my work on recreating the UI for my website
